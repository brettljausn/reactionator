This is a Shiny-Webapp written in R for simulating complex chemical reaction networks.
## Getting Started

Download the repository and run _app.R_.

### Prerequisites

   * R  
   you can download it from https://www.r-project.org/. Version 3.4.2 has been used for developement, though it will most likely work with newer and older versions.

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/brettljausn/reactionator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## Versioning

We use a [SemVer](http://semver.org/)-approach for versioning. The app does not have APIs which can change, so I decided to increment the major version when there are major GUI-changes.
